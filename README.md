# Dynamic-MKP-Benchmark-Best-Known-results
 
This is the repository of currently best results for [Dynamic-MKP-Benchmark-Datasets](https://github.com/jonasska/Dynamic-MKP-Benchmark-Datasets). Some of the results might not be optimal due to NP-Hard nature of MKP.

Each result file represents all best known solutions for all states of Dynamic MKP. In each row first column is state number, second column is total state's result score, and further columns represent solution vector.

If you find better solution for any of the datasets or individual states please feel free to raise Pull Request.
